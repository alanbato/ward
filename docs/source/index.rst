Ward - A modern Python test framework
=====================================

Ward is a modern test framework for Python with a focus on productivity and readability.

Features
--------
* Describe your tests using strings instead of function names
* Use plain ``assert`` statements, with no need to remember ``assert*`` method names
* Beautiful output that focuses on readability
* Supported on MacOS, Linux, and Windows
* Manage test dependencies using a simple but powerful :ref:`fixture system <fixtures>`
* Support for :ref:`testing async code<async_tests>`
* :ref:`Parameterised testing <parameterisation>` allows you to run a single test on multiple inputs
* Configurable with :ref:`pyproject.toml<pyproject>`, but works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults
* Speedy -- Ward's suite of ~300 tests completes in ~0.4 seconds on my machine

Installation
------------
Ward is available on PyPI, and can be installed with ``pip install ward`` (Python 3.6+ required).

A Quick Taste
-------------

Here's a simple example of a test written using Ward:

.. code-block:: python

    # file: test_example.py
    from ward import test

    @test("the list contains 42")
    def _():
        assert 42 in [-21, 42, 999]

To run the test, simply run ``ward`` in your terminal, and Ward will let you know how it went:
